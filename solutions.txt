# Part A:

## Recovered password

[('cecio', '02361267'), ('bjacobsen', '22005597')]

## Pseudocode for attack

for all passwords of length n
    if hashed user,password,salt == known hash
        found correct password

## Worst case running time

## Discussion of current proposal and suggestions for improvement
    1. Stricter password requirements. Including lower case chars + upper case
       extends running time to O(62^n). Symbols make this larger.
    2. Slower hashing algorithms than sha256 will make it more difficult to 
       go through all cases.
